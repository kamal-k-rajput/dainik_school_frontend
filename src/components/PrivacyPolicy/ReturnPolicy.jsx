          You have 24 hours to return an e-course from the date you purchased
          it. A Refund Request will be deemed valid only if it is made through
          an email to dainikschool@gmail.com within 24 hours of purchase. No
          Refund requests would be entertained after 24 hours from the date of

            If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your
            original method of payment. You will receive the credit within a
            certain amount of days (minimum 5-7 working days), depending on your
            card issuerâ€™s policies.
