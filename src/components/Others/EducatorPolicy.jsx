        <h4>RESPONDING TO COURSE REVIEWS</h4>
        <p>
          Reviews and ratings are a critical tool in helping parents decide
          which course is right for them. At DAINIK SCHOOL, our customers write
          reviews after they complete the course. Although low reviews may
          frustrate educators, it is critical that even low reviews stand in
          order to protect the integrity of the review system.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not attempt to artificially inflate your ratings for any
          reason. Examples of this might be: giving discounts for reviews,
          enrolling your friends or family to leave reviews, Such actions may
          result in restriction or removal.
        </p>
        <h4>DISPUTING REVIEWS</h4>
        <p>
          Our general policy is to not alter course reviews; instead, Learners
          can update their reviews. However, there are instances where our team
          will investigate and determine if it is appropriate to remove all or
          part of a written review. If a full written review is removed, the
          star rating will also be removed. DAINIK SCHOOL only removes or edits
          reviews for the complaints that are unrelated to a teacher’s actions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Missed session reviews - If a negative review is about the
            session instruction and the learner never attended the session.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tech issues - when the learner faces issues in joining or accessing
            the recording.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following instructions - When the learner didn’t follow clearly
            written instructions to prepare for the session and the team can
            prove that educators have conveyed the same. If the threat of
            leaving or removing a poor review was used as a tool to extract
            refunds, i.e. a customer threatened to leave a review if they did
            not receive a refund.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a review contains inappropriate content, we will typically edit
            the inappropriate section out, but may remove the entire review if
            the review cannot be rendered ‘appropriate and comprehensible’ with
            minimal editing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>REVIEW REMOVAL PROCESS</h4>
        <p>
          If a teacher would like to remove a review please do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that it falls into one of the examples of what constitutes
            a review removal pointer.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it does, fill out this form to provide our Support Team with more
            detailed information about the review. Make sure to fill out all
            required fields and provide as much specific information as
            possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            The teacher will be notified of the outcome of the inquiry. We aim
            to resolve all disputes within two weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon completing its investigation, the Training Team’s decision is
            final.
          </li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <b>
          Please note: Review Disputes must be submitted within 10 days of the
          posting of the review.

        <h4>DAINIK SCHOOL COLLABORATION WITH SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS</h4>
        <p>
          DAINIK SCHOOL is excited to be working with schools to impart actual
          learning experiences for young learners and connecting them with their
          passion and interest. DAINIK SCHOOL collaborates with schools via
          third parties wherein we offer selected courses to school on their
          demand or taste. When DAINIK SCHOOL brings school learners then the
          revenue share is distributed to DAINIK SCHOOL and its Educators, third
          parties and school.
        </p>
        <h4>YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT DATA</h4>
        <p>
          When DAINIK SCHOOL works with schools, the personal information
          provided about a student as well as any information collected during
          the delivery of DAINIK SCHOOL’s services is considered to be
          “educational records” As a teacher, you will have access to student
          data for learners enrolled in your course. You should only access the
          student data for the time period needed to instruct that learner. As a
          reminder, all student data is confidential and may only be used by you
          to deliver or improve your curriculum. Disclosure, sharing or selling
          any student data is strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <h4>
          YOU MUST ENSURE ALL STUDENT DATA REMAINS ON THE DAINIK SCHOOL PLATFORM
        </h4>
        <p>
          Teachers are required to teach all live sessions in website or in app
          through the DAINIK SCHOOL platform, and may not host DAINIK SCHOOL
          sessions on any platform outside of DAINIK SCHOOL . All communication
          between teachers and parents and/or their students should occur
          through the DAINIK SCHOOL platform. Using the DAINIK SCHOOL platform
          helps ensure that proper data management, privacy, and security
          practices are followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything that you see on the DAINIK SCHOOL platform must remain on the
          DAINIK SCHOOL platform. We recognize that some sessions may require
          learners to send digital assignments to you for assessment; in the
          case that you cannot complete an assessment within the system, you are
          required to ensure you do not retain any learner data for longer than
          your time teaching the learner. Should you have any physical documents
          or printouts that contain learner data, they must be destroyed when
          they are no longer needed to provide services to that student.
          Shredding is the preferred destruction method for physical documents.
        </p>
        <h4>COMMUNICATE WITH LEARNER THROUGH DAINIK SCHOOL</h4>
        <p>
          All communication between Learner and teachers should occur through
          the DAINIK SCHOOL platform. In order to ensure that all users have a
          high quality, safe and positive experience on DAINIK SCHOOL, our
          support team needs to have visibility into what’s been going on.
          Incase of any mishap, the team can check for both sides and
          accordingly address the issues. If the learner and teacher uses
          private chat for communication it will be difficult for the team to do
          so.The same goes for payments that take place outside of DAINIK
          SCHOOL. The support team can only assist with refunds and verify
          payments that take place through the DAINIK SCHOOL.
        </p>

        <h4>TEACHER RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY</h4>
        <p>
          Regardless of the topic you are teaching or the age group you are
          working with, you have a responsibility to create a safe online
          classroom environment. For this reason, teachers are required to teach
          all live classes in website and in all through the DAINIK SCHOOL
          platform. While parents are responsible for supervising their kids, we
          expect that you teach your classes in a way that encourages physical
          safety, mental wellbeing, and online privacy for all students. Poor
          judgment on safety and privacy can result in Removal

            Teachers are required to keep their cameras on while teaching a live
            class.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the teacher, you should be present and supervise your meeting at
            all times. Please make sure you are able to be at your computer for
            the entire time that app is open and your live class is running.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before running your first class, be fluent in your app
            features you'll use to manage your classroom and respond quickly if
            safety or behavior problems arise.

            Parents are able to listen into class at a reasonable distance from
            their learner or watch the recording later, but it is against DAINIK
            SCHOOL’s policies for a parent to listen in or watch class from a
            separate device.
          </li>
